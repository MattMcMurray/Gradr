evan: Has anyone had issues with foreign keys not being enforced with sqlite before?
mattmcmurray: Not that I can remember. I was doing some fk work last night, so I'll let ya know what I figure out if it works 
evan: How were you establishing the FK rule?
evan: I tried the 'references' attribute when setting up the model with FKs, when I look at the schema it has the rules,  but I can still insert records with FKs that don't exist
evan: It's on my branch that I pushed, not quite done yet though
evan: (like_dislike_user)
mattmcmurray: Hmm, yeah I didn't check to see if the rule is enforced
evan: Seemed to just be an issue with `upsert()`, I used `findOneOrCreate()` instead and it works fine now

jorell: that\u2019s cool.

jorell: I\u2019ve only used json and csv
evan: This tool is sweet
jorell: yeah. it has like 90 different types of data
jorell: unfortunate that there\u2019s no school option.
evan: Can you give it an array of phrases that it would just use randomly?
jorell: you can apparnetly use Regex

jorell: But i think since there\u2019s a city, we can fake it and just do like \u201cUniversity of \u201c + json.city
evan: Yeah that would be a good solution
evan: I'll use it to make a db fill script tomorrow
jorell: Yeah, you can just wipe the current DB

caleb: great, thanks
jorell: <!channel>: how does everyone feel about sqlite and sequelize?
evan: I like sqlite, I tolerate sequelize
jorell: haha fair enough.
evan: I haven't run into THAT many issues with sequelize though, so I'm fine with still using it
jorell: So, what does everyone else think?
keanek: I haven't had any issues with either, although I sort of dodged working on user matches and the foreign key problems.
caleb: I like SQLite, I would much rather be able to just use queries as I know them, as opposed to translating them into sequelize's format
evan: Sequelize does have that ability though
caleb: it does, though I feel like whenever I do it that way, I'm doing so in bad form, as its different from all the other instances of us accessing data
evan: It's a tradeoff, some complex queries could look like a nested pile of garbage if we stuck with using native functions for sequelize though. I would much prefer seeing raw SQL in those cases.
